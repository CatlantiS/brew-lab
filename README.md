# brew-lab

This is going to be a web app for creating, sharing and improving beer recipes. 

---

If you want to get the app running, you will need **MongoDB** for the backend, and **npm** and **bower** for managing packages.

Check out the [documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) for installing mongo in your environment. 

You can get nmp with node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/download/).

Then once you clone the source, run `npm install` in the app root directory.

If you don't have bower, you can install it with npm, `npm install -g bower`.

Then run bower, `bower install`.

You will need gulp for the task runner.  

`npm install -g gulp` to install it globally.

Execute gulp in the app root directory by typing *gulp* in the command line.

It will watch the app for changes and compile the necessary files.

After that you should be good to go.
