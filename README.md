# brew-lab

This is going to be a web app for creating, sharing and improving beer recipes. 

---

If you want to get the app running, you will need **MongoDB** for the backend, and **npm** and **bower** for managing packages.

Check out the <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/" target="_blank">documentation</a> for installing mongo in your environment. 

You can get npm with Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Then once you clone the source, run 

`npm install` 

in the app root directory.

If you don't have bower, you can install it with 

`npm install -g bower` 

to install it globally.

Then run 

`bower install`

You will need gulp for the task runner 

`npm install -g gulp`

Execute gulp in the app root directory by typing `gulp` in the command line.

It will watch the app for changes and compile the necessary files.

Then you should be good to go.
